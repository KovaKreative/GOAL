# Syntax

- For components, I'm using .js extension instead of .jsx. We will likely want to create custom hooks for this and that, but I do want to leave the option open to have some javascript functions and logic within those files. -Eric

- GIT commit messages should be done in present tense, (e.g. "Create Chat.js component"). This is something mentors got very picky about when evaluating my projects. -Eric
